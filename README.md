- ServerStorage, ServerScriptService, and more

### Networking (15+ paths)
- ReplicatedStorage events and functions
- Core networking events for item distribution
- Lobby networking for party/item management

### Memory Systems (10+ paths)
- Performance stats memory categories
- Core memory and place memory analysis
- Script memory and heap analysis

### Tool Storage (5+ paths)
- ReplicatedStorage.Tools
- StarterPack and StarterGui
- Server-side tool repositories

## Methods Used

### Primary Methods
1. **Direct Tool Manipulation**: Clone tools from ReplicatedStorage
2. **Network Events**: Fire item-related remote events
3. **Network Functions**: Invoke item distribution functions
4. **Memory Manipulation**: Modify memory values for item counts
5. **Player Scripts**: Access inventory controllers
6. **Workspace Systems**: Manipulate game world objects

### Backup Methods
1. **Inventory Modification**: Directly modify existing tool amounts
2. **StarterGear Access**: Use starter gear as item source

4. **Server Storage**: Access server-side tool repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Player not found"**
- Ensure target player "jdiishere6" is in the game
- Check player name spelling

**"No items added"**
- Try different item IDs
- Use self-test to validate systems
- Check console for detailed error messages

**"Path not found"**
- Click "Rediscover Paths" to find new paths
- Game may have been updated

### Debug Information

- **Console Output**: All actions are logged with timestamps
- **Script Log**: Access `_G.ScriptLog` for detailed action history
- **Path Cache**: Check `_G.pathCache` for resolved paths
- **Workspace Dump**: Access `_G.WorkspaceDump` for game structure analysis

## Safety Features

- **Safe Networking**: Only uses verified safe remote events
- **Error Boundaries**: All operations wrapped in pcall for crash prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to prevent spam detection
- **Access Validation**: Checks permissions before attempting operations

## Performance
